# Detecting-Breast-Cancer-using-KNN

Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control. Breast cancer cells usually form a tumor that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women, but men can get breast cancer, too.

When the dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) was applied on my KNN classifier and results comes out with an accuracy of 99.12%.
